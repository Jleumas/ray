# ray
This repo implements the ray tracing project as described in Jamis Buck's "The Ray Tracer Challenge". Code will not be organized as implemented by chapter, but will instead be organized logically in a manner consistent with the organic development of a ray tracing project. 

The intent of this project is to better understand project organization and the Go programming language, and is a work in progress.
